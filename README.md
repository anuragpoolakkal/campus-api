## Campus App Setup Documentation

This setup documentation provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Campus App on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (with npm): Download and install from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB: Download and install from [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the Campus App repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file.
2. Define the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/campusDB
   ```

   - `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run.
   - `MONGODB_URI`: The connection URI for your MongoDB database.

### Step 4: Start MongoDB

1. Start MongoDB service on your local machine. Use the following command:

   ```
   mongod
   ```

<!-- ### Step 5: Seed Initial Data (Optional)

If your application requires initial data, you can seed the database with sample data.

1. Check the `seedData.js` file in the project directory to ensure it contains the necessary initial data.
2. Run the following command to seed the database:

   ```
   node seedData.js
   ``` -->

### Step 5: Start the Server

1. Run the following command to start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the Express server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is running on the specified port.

### Step 6: Access the Campus App

1. Open your web browser.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Campus App.
3. You should now be able to use the Campus App on your local machine.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to replace `<repository_url>` in Step 1 with the actual URL of the Campus App repository.
- Ensure that MongoDB is running before starting the server to establish a connection with the database.
- Customize the `.env` file according to your specific configuration requirements.
- For production deployment, consider configuring additional settings such as security measures, logging, and environment variables specific to your deployment environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up the Campus App on your local machine and start developing or testing it.
